- [x] Pull daily information from subreddits about active users, subscribers, posts, comments, upvotes, comment:score ratio and more.
- [x] Track info in either CSV,xsls, SQL, pandas, etc.
- [x] Plot active user count vs time, posts per hour vs active user count, number of comments vs score, etc.
- [ ] Include functionality for making plots and dataframes of multiple subreddits simultaneously.
